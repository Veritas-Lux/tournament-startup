    <h1>About the Startup</h1>
    <section>
        <h2> Starting the Startup </h2>
        <p> Two turning points occured during my sophomore year: a failure and a success.  </p>
        <h3>The Failure</h3>
        <p> In November, I bombed the most important competition in the nation, the American Mathematics Competitions (AMC). 
            <br>  At the time, I was completely devastated because high AMC scores unlocked many opportunities such as prestigious summer programs, and I felt like I had no chance.
           <br>  My math career and my dreams were crumbling away. 
            <br>  However, I realized in the weeks after that I was much more than math. I tried new things: self-studying, poetry, and volunteering.  </p>
        <br> 
        <h3>The Success</h3>   
        <p>Speaking of volunteering, I was especially eager to help out with my high school's annual math tournament, the biggest in the state. 
            We put a lot of effort into writing the problems and organizing the tests, and it's hard work. 
            In 2022, my Freshman year, the Scantrons weren't bubbled in correctly and the awards ceremony was delayed quite a lot. 
            In 2023, we hand-bubbled more than 1000 Scantrons to prevent the scoring issues! 
             <br> 
            My friends from a faraway city enjoyed the competition and they wanted to start one at their school. 
            I'm blessed to live in a vibrant math community, a privilege my friends and many others do not have.
             <br> 
            <b>Math interest starts with strong communities. Competitions are a great way for students to make friends and feel supported.</b>
             <br>  I remembered all the work we put into the tournament and wondered, "Is there an easier way to organize math competitions?" </p>

        <h2> Goals </h2>
        <p> Help others start their own math tournaments by breaking the process down step-by-step.
         <br> Cultiave math communities in underserved areas
          <br> Inspire others with <li><a href="blog.html">my stories</a></li> and <li><a href="stories.html">success stories</a></li>.
