        <h2>About The Startup</h2>
        <p> I'm blessed to live in a vibrant math community. Every year, my school hosts the biggest math tournament in the state.
        We put a lot of effort into writing the problems and organizing the tests, but something always goes wrong.
        In 2022, my Freshman year, the Scantrons weren't bubbled in correctly and the awards ceremony was delayed quite a lot.
        In 2023, we hand-bubbled more than 1000 Scantrons to prevent the scoring issues, but the awards presentation was wrong. 
        Still, my friends from a faraway city enjoyed the competition and they wanted to start one at their school. 
        I was also thinking, "Shouldn't there be an easier way to organize math competitions?"
        So here it is!
